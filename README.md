# N-Queens Problem in Java

The N-Queens Problem is a combinatorial problem where the task is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in a way that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Java Solution

The Java solution involves implementing a backtracking algorithm to explore possible queen placements on the chessboard, making sure to backtrack when a solution cannot be reached. The goal is to find all distinct solutions for placing N queens on the board without any conflicts.

## Tests Using Junit

The code can be tested using the test class "NQueensSolverTest" testing the N value of 1 - 10.
